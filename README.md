# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

## Overview

This project analyzes telecom customer data to identify key factors
driving customer churn and builds a predictive model to detect customers
at risk of leaving.

## Tools & Technologies

-   Python
-   Pandas, NumPy
-   Matplotlib, Seaborn
-   Scikit-learn
-   SMOTE (class imbalance handling)

## Key Steps

-   Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-   Encoded categorical features and prepared data for modeling
-   Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE
-   Compared multiple models using cross-validation
-   Selected Random Forest for churn prediction
-   Built a reusable prediction workflow using saved model and encoders

## Outcome

Developed a churn prediction model to support data-driven customer
retention strategies.
